# Claude Code Rules for Dotfiles

> Extends `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Subsystem docs in `.claude/rules/` (loaded on-demand by path).

## Core Rules

### Setup Script Compatibility
- ALWAYS check if `scripts/setup.sh` needs modification when adding new tools
- ALWAYS verify new dependencies are in the Brewfile and setup script
- ALWAYS ensure PATH configs are added to both Fish and Zsh configs

### File Location Constraints
- NEVER create or modify files outside `~/dotfiles` (EXCEPT `~/neovim` for Neovim config)
- ALWAYS ensure tools/configs can be installed via stow or setup script
- CRITICAL: tmux config must ONLY exist at `~/dotfiles/.tmux.conf` — never `.config/tmux/`
- Neovim config lives in `~/neovim` (separate repo, NOT part of dotfiles)

### Symlink Management
- ALWAYS use GNU Stow for all configuration symlinking
- NEVER manually create symlinks or copy config files to home directory
- ALWAYS test stow operations before considering changes complete

## Project Overview

- **Purpose**: Personal macOS dev environment (dotfiles + stow + automated setup)
- **Shell**: Fish (primary), Zsh (secondary with Oh My Zsh)
- **Editor**: Neovim (LazyVim) at `~/neovim`, symlinked to `~/.config/nvim`
- **Terminal**: Ghostty, WezTerm, iTerm2 | **Multiplexer**: tmux with TPM
- **Packages**: Homebrew (`homebrew/Brewfile`) | **LSPs**: Nix-based (`nix/global/`)
- **Theme**: Tokyo Night consistent across all applications

### File Organization
- Application configs → `.config/` subdirectories
- Shell configs → dotfiles root level
- Scripts → `scripts/` directory
- Package management → `homebrew/` directory

### Adding New Tools
- **CLI Tools**: Brewfile → Fish PATH → setup.sh → aliases/functions → Zsh compatibility
- **GUI Apps**: Brewfile cask → setup.sh check → `.config/` subdirectory → Tokyo Night theme
- **Plugins**: Fish=Fisher, tmux=TPM, Neovim=LazyVim (in `~/neovim`)

## Development Standards

- ALWAYS add new packages to `homebrew/Brewfile`
- ALWAYS update `scripts/setup.sh` when adding new tools
- ALWAYS maintain consistent theming (Tokyo Night) across applications
- ALWAYS use Fish shell syntax for primary shell configurations
- ALWAYS include Zsh compatibility for broader system support
- PATH management: add new tool paths to both Fish and setup script

### LSP Management
- Three-tier system: Global baseline → Project override → Neovim detection
- Use Nix flakes for project-specific LSP versions (not Mason.nvim)
- See `nix/README.md` for architecture and inheritance patterns

## Quality Assurance

### Before Committing
- Verify setup script works, stow completes, theme consistency maintained
- Validate Fish and Zsh configurations work correctly

### Troubleshooting
- **Missing PATH**: Add to both Fish config and setup script
- **Theme Inconsistency**: Check Tokyo Night theme application
- **Plugin Failures**: Verify plugin managers are properly configured
- **Stow Conflicts**: Resolve symlink conflicts before deployment

## Agent Workflow Guidance

- Practical agent rules in root `AGENTS.md`
- **Slam dunks**: `gwt-ticket` or `ralph-loop` for well-defined tasks
- **Research**: Surveying fields, producing comparison summaries
- **Single Agent Rule**: One background agent at a time

### When NOT to Use Agents
- Karabiner-Elements config (use GUI), Brewfile organization, tmux plugin installation (TPM)
- Theme consistency verification, 1Password/SSH setup, stow conflict resolution
- LazyVim plugin config (lives in `~/neovim`)

### Kubernetes Manifests
- ALWAYS place manifests in `scripts/manifests/` with descriptive filenames
- ALWAYS update `scripts/manifests/README.md` with usage and purpose

### Docker Container Testing
- ALWAYS test cross-platform changes in containers (start with Ubuntu)
- ALWAYS verify stow operations and shell configs load without errors
- Location: `scripts/docker/`. See `scripts/docker/README.md`
